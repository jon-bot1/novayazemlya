Subject: Andrei Pavlovich Osipovitj
Rank: Commandant
Unit: Special Group "Wolf"
Station: Objekt 47 "Severnyj Vektor", Underground Section

BACKGROUND:
Osipovitj was recruited from Spetsnaz in 1977. Outstanding combat record — 47 confirmed operations. Psychological profile shows extreme loyalty to the project but rising instability since the exposure.

His two personal bodyguards, callsigns ZAPAD and VOSTOK, have served with him since 1979. Both are former GRU special operators. They never leave his side.

EXPOSURE:
During inspection of Laboratory No. 3 (see "Dawn" protocol), Osipovitj was exposed to an unknown substance from B-series containers. Since then, subordinates report:
- Unnatural strength (bent a steel bar with bare hands)
- Eyes that "glow" in the dark
- Insomnia for 23 days without performance degradation
- Conversations with "voices" — claims to hear orders from below

ASSESSMENT:
Despite instability, Osipovitj is the most effective commander at Objekt 47. He has refused evacuation, stating he "guards what lies beneath". Personnel report he patrols the deep storage at night, armed and muttering. ZAPAD and VOSTOK follow in silence.

RECOMMENDATION: Monitor. Do NOT neutralize without direct orders. His knowledge of the B-series is irreplaceable.

WARNING: If Osipovitj shows signs of total regression — activate protocol STORM-3 immediately.

Situation is no longer containable.

Dr. Kravtsov has lost all semblance of professional conduct. He spends 18 hours a day in the basement with Subject 7. He talks TO it. He reads it poetry. He calls it "my masterpiece."

Last week, the subject spoke through 40cm of reinforced concrete. Every patient on the ward above heard it. Three had seizures. One tore out his own IV and ran into the snow. We found him frozen 2km from the perimeter.

The subject has not eaten in 31 days. It does not sleep. It WATCHES. Through the walls. I know this sounds insane, but the guards confirm — it tracks movement in adjacent rooms without visual contact.

I am ordering all non-essential personnel to evacuate. Dr. Kravtsov refuses to leave. He says the subject "is not ready yet."

Ready for WHAT?

If this report does not receive a response within 48 hours, I am activating Protocol Ash on my own authority.

Subject: Viktor Semyonovich Dragunov
Known as: "Nachalnik" (The Boss)
Last known position: Fishing Village Pier Authority

BACKGROUND:
Dragunov served 8 years in the Soviet Navy, Black Sea Fleet. Dishonorably discharged in 1980 after an incident involving the disappearance of three crew members during a storm. Investigation inconclusive.

After discharge, he established control over a small fishing village on the northern coast. Within two years, he had turned the legitimate fishing operation into a smuggling network — weapons, contraband, and occasionally people.

DISTINGUISHING FEATURES:
- Always carries a massive industrial fish hook, repurposed as a close-combat weapon. Hook is approximately 40cm long, sharpened to a razor edge.
- Missing left ring finger (fishing accident, 1976)
- Tattoo of an anchor on right forearm
- Speaks with a deep voice, rarely shouts — his men fear his quiet commands more than any officer's screams

KNOWN ASSOCIATES:
- Two personal bodyguards, former navy men
- Pack of trained dogs used for perimeter security
- Network of "redneck" smugglers from nearby settlements

WARNING:
Dragunov is extremely dangerous in close quarters. Multiple reports of him using his hook to incapacitate opponents before they can draw weapons. He is known to charge directly at armed targets — do NOT let him close the distance.

His men call him "Nachalnik" — The Boss. On the pier, his word is law.

Day 1: Arrived at Norrberget Mining Village. Tasked with mapping magnetic anomalies in Sections 8-12 by order of the Royal Survey Office. Mine Director Holmström greeted me personally. Seemed nervous.

Day 3: Readings are extraordinary. The magnetic field at 350m depth is 400% above regional average. My compass spins freely below 300m. Instruments behave as if there's a massive ferromagnetic body beneath us, but the geology doesn't support it.

Day 5: Reached 400m with portable magnetometer. Readings went OFF SCALE. The needle bent. Not figuratively — the physical needle of my analog backup instrument bent toward the east wall. I've never seen anything like this in 20 years of fieldwork.

Day 6: Holmström asked me not to include the 400m readings in my official report. I refused. He offered money. I still refused.

Day 7: Found a chamber behind the sealed concrete in Drift 7. There's a gap — maybe 30cm — at the top. I shone my flashlight through.

I saw the crystals. Black. Tall. Arranged in a semicircle around... something. The magnetometer reading through the gap was so high it broke the instrument.

I need to go back. I need to see what's in the center of that circle.

Stålhandske, Royal Survey Office, supplementary recording. June 19th. It's... I think it's around midnight. I came back alone. Brought tools to widen the gap in the Drift 7 seal.

*Scraping of concrete, grunting*

I'm through. The chamber is... larger than I expected. Much larger. The crystals are — God, they're beautiful. Obsidian black but with an inner glow. Like captured starlight. There must be thirty of them, each three meters tall, forming a perfect circle.

And in the center... it's not a void. There's a shape. Like a figure carved from the mountain itself. But the proportions are wrong — too old, too angular. Pre-human. Pre-everything.

The magnetometer is useless down here. The field is so strong my watch has stopped.

It opened its eyes.

*Silence — then a deep, subsonic rumble*

They're not crystals. They're not rock formations. They're TEETH. The whole circle — it's a MOUTH.

And Ort — the western formation — it's moving. Toward me. Slowly. Like a glacier. But WATCHING.

Subject: Björn Stålhandske, age 43, Survey Engineer, Royal Survey Office
Last seen: June 18, 1955, Norrberget Mining Village

SUMMARY:
Stålhandske arrived at Norrberget Mine on June 14 for a routine magnetic survey. Was quartered in Cabin 3 at the mining village. Reported to work daily through June 18.

On June 19, workers arriving for morning shift found:
- Stålhandske's cabin empty, bed unslept in
- His equipment case at the entrance to sealed Drift 7
- The concrete seal on Drift 7 INTACT (no signs of tampering)
- A cassette recorder inside the equipment case (tape confiscated by Mine Director Holmström — see note)

INVESTIGATION:
- All mine tunnels searched. No trace of Stålhandske.
- Holmström claims Stålhandske left on foot during the night. No witnesses.
- Stålhandske's car remains in the village parking area.
- His wallet, passport, and personal effects remain in Cabin 3.
- The cassette tape was surrendered to County Police but subsequently transferred to military custody by order of Colonel Varga, Northern Military District.

NOTE FROM INVESTIGATING OFFICER:
The concrete seal on Drift 7 shows no damage. If Stålhandske entered Drift 7, he did so without breaking the seal. This is physically impossible.

However, I note the following: when I placed my hand on the concrete seal, it was WARM. Concrete at 390m depth should be approximately 12°C. The seal was at least 30°C.

Additionally, workers report that since Stålhandske's disappearance, the magnetic anomaly readings at 350m have increased by 15%.

Almost as if the mountain gained mass.

STATUS: CASE CLOSED — Classified by military order.
Filed as: "Presumed desertion."

— Inspector Grip

PERSONAL ADDENDUM (not in official file):
I don't believe he deserted. I believe the mountain took him. And I believe Holmström knows it.`,

SUBJECT: SUBSTANCE ZERO (SZ-0)

SUMMARY:
A pre-Cambrian material has been identified in the Arctic bedrock spanning from northern Scandinavia to the Novaya Zemlya archipelago. The geological vein runs at depths between 380-500 meters, following the ancient Caledonian fault line.

Soviet GRU discovered the material during underground nuclear testing on Novaya Zemlya in 1954. They designated it "Вещество Ноль" (Substance Zero). Swedish miners at Norrberget independently encountered it in 1947 but sealed the deposits in 1964 after multiple incidents.

STRATEGIC VALUE:
When refined, SZ-0 amplifies nuclear fission chain reactions by a factor of 12. A single enhanced warhead could produce yields equivalent to 600 kilotons. This would render NATO's entire nuclear deterrence doctrine obsolete.

Soviet assets along the vein:
1. OBJEKT 47 — Primary extraction & refinery (Novaya Zemlya)
2. COASTAL VILLAGE — Maritime export pipeline (Arctic coast)
3. HOSPITAL №6 — Human resistance research (near Objekt 47)
4. NORRBERGET MINE — Source site, recently reopened (Sweden)

NOTE: The material exhibits properties inconsistent with any known substance. It absorbs sound. It generates magnetic fields. Workers exposed to it report auditory hallucinations. In at least three confirmed cases, exposed individuals have been physically ABSORBED into the rock.

This is not a mineral. This is something else.

RE: Swedish geological anomaly — URGENT

Comrades,

Our source in the Swedish Geological Survey (codename BJÖRK) has confirmed what we suspected: the magnetic anomaly discovered at Norrberget Mine in 1947 is the SAME geological vein we identified beneath Novaya Zemlya during the 1954 tests.

The vein spans the entire Arctic bedrock. It is not a deposit — it is a NETWORK. Like roots beneath a forest. And it is all connected.

The Swedes sealed their mine in 1964 after a series of incidents — worker disappearances, equipment failures, a survey engineer named Stålhandske who vanished without trace in 1957. They blamed "ore depletion." They lied.

I recommend immediate action:
1. Infiltrate Norrberget under cover of "geological cooperation"
2. Reopen the sealed levels below 400m
3. Establish direct extraction pipeline to Objekt 47

The Swedish government must not learn the true nature of what lies beneath their territory. If NATO discovers the vein extends to Scandinavia, they will destroy the sites themselves.

Speed is essential. The substance is not patient. It... responds to attention.

— Varga

P.S. The confiscated Stålhandske tape is in my safe. What he recorded before his disappearance is... disturbing. His magnetometer readings confirm the vein is alive. I use that word deliberately.`,

Day one of Aurora Borealis. CONTROL handed me the mission dossier in a parking garage in Oslo. Fitting — my whole life has been lived in shadows.

Father disappeared when I was two years old. Mother never recovered. She kept his compass on the kitchen table — the needle bent, always pointing north-northeast. Toward Norrberget. She said it broke the day he went into the mine. I think she was right, but not in the way she meant. The compass didn't break. It found what it was looking for.

CONTROL says the Soviets have been extracting a substance from the Arctic bedrock — something that amplifies nuclear reactions. Something they found during the tests on Novaya Zemlya. And it's the same thing my father found at Norrberget. The same thing that took him.

Four sites. Four raids. CONTROL says destroy them all. Collapse the vein.

I'll do it. But not just for NATO. Not just for the mission.

I'm going into that mine, CONTROL. I'm going to find out what happened to Nils Stålhandske. And if the mountain took him — I'm going to take him back.

Or I'm going to burn it all down trying.

This is Nils Stålhandske, follow-up survey, Norrberget. June 17th, 1957. I'm continuing Björn's work — my colleague who disappeared here two years ago. The Survey Office wants answers. So do I.

*Sound of elevator descending*

I've reached the 400m level. Magnetometer is reading off-scale, same as Björn reported. But I've brought a new instrument — a gravimeter. And the readings are... wrong. The gravitational field here is 0.3% higher than surface. That shouldn't be possible. There's something very dense beneath us.

*Footsteps, echoing in tunnel*

I've found Björn's equipment case. It's right where the report said — at the Drift 7 seal. But...

*Long pause*

The concrete seal has a crack in it. A new crack. It wasn't in the photos from '55. And there's... condensation on the concrete. Like it's breathing.

I can hear something. Not with my ears. In my BONES. A low frequency, sub-20 hertz. Infrasound. It's making my chest vibrate.

I'm going to place the gravimeter against the seal and take a deep reading.

*Sound of equipment being positioned*

The reading is... God. The mass behind this seal is equivalent to... that can't be right. Recalibrating.

*Silence for ten seconds*

Same reading. There's something behind this wall with the density of IRON. Hundreds of tonnes. And it's...

*Sharp crack — stone splitting*

...the seal is opening. I didn't touch it. The concrete is SPLITTING from the inside.

Light. There's light coming through. Blue light.

And something is... looking at me. Through the crack. I can feel it.

Father's compass — it's spinning. Faster and faster. The needle is—

I have to go in. I know I shouldn't. But I have to go in. It WANTS me to see.

NATO Task Force AURORA — Classification ULTRAVIOLET

During Operation Polar Whisper (November 1984), SIGINT teams monitoring Soviet frequencies from Tromsø detected an anomaly in the aurora borealis. Standard auroral emissions produce electromagnetic noise in the VLF range. What we detected was structured.

The aurora above the Substance Zero geological vein carries a signal. Not random interference — organized patterns. Repeating sequences. When graphed, the waveforms resemble neural firing patterns.

We believe Substance Zero emits electromagnetic radiation that ionizes the upper atmosphere along the vein. The aurora borealis above these sites is not natural. It is the substance communicating with itself — across hundreds of kilometers, through the sky.

The Soviets call it "Голос Сияния" — the Voice of the Aurora. Their scientists at Objekt 47 have built receivers that decode the signal. Commandant Osipovitj claims the aurora gives him orders.

Ice fishermen on the Barents coast report hearing voices when the lights are strong — conversations in a language that sounds "almost Russian, but older." One fisherman, Grigoriy Petrovitch, recorded 14 hours of aurora transmissions on a cassette deck wired to a longwave antenna. He was found frozen on the ice the next morning, the tape still running. The recording contains what sounds like a lullaby.

We recovered the tape. Analysis pending.

WARNING: Do not attempt to decode aurora transmissions without Substance Zero countermeasures. Two SIGINT operators who monitored the signal for 6+ hours developed Stage 1 symptoms.

The lights are beautiful. Do not listen to them.

This is Grigoriy. Fisherman. Barents coast, near the village. Date is... second of January, I think. The nights are so long now I forget.

I've been fishing through the ice for forty years. My father before me. His father before him. We know this sea. We know its moods.

But the lights... the lights have changed.

They used to dance. Green, sometimes white. Beautiful. Harmless. Now they... pulse. Like a heartbeat. And the colors — I've seen violet, deep red, colors that have no name. Colors the sky should not make.

[Ice cracking in the distance]

Last week, my radio picked up voices during a strong aurora. Not Russian. Not Norwegian. Something older. The words made my teeth ache. Yura, who fishes the next hole over, heard them too. He packed up and left. Smart man.

I stayed. I built an antenna from copper wire and connected it to my recorder. I wanted proof.

[Long pause]

The lights spoke to me directly last night. Not through the radio. Through the ice. I felt the words vibrating through my boots, up through my bones. They said my name. They said "Гриша, иди к нам." Grisha, come to us.

[Voice breaking]

The compass doesn't work anymore. It spins. The fish have stopped biting — they've gone deep, deeper than my line can reach. Something down there is... pulling them.

I should go home. But the lights are so beautiful tonight. The comet is out — that new one, the bright one the scientists talk about on the radio. It's directly above the village, like it's watching.

I'll fish one more hour. One more.

Objekt 47 — Signals Division

ABSTRACT:
The electromagnetic emissions from Substance Zero ionize the mesosphere directly above geological vein sites, creating an artificial aurora. This aurora can be modulated to carry encoded signals — effectively using the northern lights as a communications medium.

We have designated this system "СИЯНИЕ" (RADIANCE).

OPERATIONAL PARAMETERS:
- Range: Confirmed signal coherence across 1,400 km (Novaya Zemlya to Norrberget)
- Bandwidth: Low — approximately 30 baud equivalent
- Encryption: Inherent — only SZ-tuned receivers can decode
- Interception risk: Minimal — signal appears as natural auroral noise to standard equipment

ADVANTAGES:
- Cannot be jammed by conventional means
- No physical infrastructure required
- Operates continuously during polar night (4+ months)
- Signal strength increases with aurora intensity

DISADVANTAGES:
- Unreliable during geomagnetic storms
- Operators report "secondary voices" on the channel — source unknown
- Extended monitoring causes SZ exposure symptoms
- The comet (designated C/1984-K2) appears to amplify the signal unpredictably

COMMANDANT'S NOTE (handwritten):
"The secondary voices are not interference. They are the mountain's thoughts, carried on light. I have learned to listen. I have learned to answer. The aurora is not our tool — we are its antenna."
— A.P. Osipovitj

DIRECTOR'S NOTE:
Disregard Commandant's annotation. Schedule psychiatric evaluation.
